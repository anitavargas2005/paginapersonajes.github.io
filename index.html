                <h2>King of Demons</h2>
                <p>King Clawthorne is the tritagonist of The Owl House. He is a young titan (initially believed to be a Demon) who is Eda's sidekick and later adoptive son, and Luz's best friend.
                     Initially, he sought to restore his supposed title and glory as the "King of Demons", before he switched to trying to discover his family and reunite with them. 
                     However, it is later discovered that he is actually the last of the titan race, and the son of the Titan, whose remains form the Boiling Isles. This revelation gives King a 
                     new outlook on life, and after reflecting on himself, he comes to accept his identity, but doesn't let it define him. King's new goal is to protect those he cares about, namely 
                     from Emperor Belos and the Collector, the latter of whom aspires to acquire King's friendship by any means necessary. </p>

                    <h2>Louise</h2>
                    <p>Louise Belcher is the third child and youngest daughter of Bob and Linda Belcher. Her off-balance sense of humor and hunger for conflict makes her somewhat of a liability 
                        in the kitchen and often gets her family both into and/or out of tricky situations. Like her siblings, Tina and Gene Belcher, Louise goes to Wagstaff School, where she is 
                        a fourth grader.  </p></div>

                    <p>Moxxie is the I.M.P's weapon specialist; and as such, has a vast knowledge of weapons and often brings a variety of them along during jobs. 

                        He is often the most vocal and realistic of the employees regarding the company as a whole despite its dysfunctional environment, and is bullied consequently. 
                        Despite being a murder-for-hire imp, it seems Moxxie is queasy with unnecessary killing beyond their targets, and uncomfortable with the idea of killing targets 
                        who have families, and attempts to give people second chances, as seen in "Murder Family". </p></div>

                    <h2>Joke Peralta</h2>
                    <p> Jacob Jeffrey "Jake" Peralta (portrayed by Andy Samberg) is the main protagonist of the show, and the only character besides  Raymond Holtto appear in every episode.
                         At the start of the series, he was a cocky and immature, but very talented and dedicated NYPD detective stationed in Brooklyn's 99th Precinct. He was often the one coming 
                         up with precinct competitions and shenanigans and not taking anything except his cases seriously. He has, however, always cared deeply about his friends and is extremely 
                         loyal. Throughout the series, due to his father-son relationship with Holt, and his partnership-turned-relationship with his now wife, Amy, Jake matured and turned into a 
                         very respectful and respectable person. In the series finale, he decides to retire from the NYPD and become a stay-at-home dad to his son Mac (born in the season 7 finale, 
                         "Lights Out") so that Amy can focus on her career.  </p></div>
